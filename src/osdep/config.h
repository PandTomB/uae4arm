 * When USE_COMPILER is defined, a m68k->i386 instruction compiler will be
 * used. This is experimental. It has only been tested on a Linux/i386 ELF
 * machine, although it might work on other i386 Unices.
 * This is supposed to speed up application programs. It will not work very
 * well for hardware bangers like games and demos, in fact it will be much
 * slower. It can also be slower for some applications and/or benchmarks.
 * It needs a lot of tuning. Please let me know your results with this.
 * The second define, RELY_ON_LOADSEG_DETECTION, decides how the compiler 
 * tries to detect self-modifying code. If it is not set, the first bytes
 * of every compiled routine are used as checksum before executing the
 * routine. If it is set, the UAE filesystem will perform some checks to 
 * detect whether an executable is being loaded. This is less reliable
 * (it won't work if you don't use the harddisk emulation, so don't try to
 * use floppies or even the RAM disk), but much faster.
 *
 * @@@ NOTE: This option is unfortunately broken in this version. Don't
 * try to use it. @@@
